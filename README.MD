# Titanic survival prediction model
This repo contains the code for a deployable machine learning algorithm. 
I built this model to learn more about Machine Learning, see section goals.

Because the goal is to understand how to deploy machine learning algorithms 
and how production code differs from the typical experimental jupyter notebook,
I decided to keep the model very simple.

The machine learning is embedded in a Python package which is integrated in the API app.

## Goal
- Understand how to deploy a machine learning model
- Understand difference between production code and experimental jupyter notebook
- Learn how to deploy a model using an API
- Use Dev-Ops tool such as Docker and Git
- Learn about CI/CD

## Tools used
- Python 3.8
- Tox
- Docker
